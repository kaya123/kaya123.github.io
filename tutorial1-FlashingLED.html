        <p>Welcome to your first tutorial!</p>
        <h2>You will need:</h3>
        <ul class="requirements">
            <li>1x Arduino <img src="./images/squareArduino.JPG"></li>

                <section>
                    <p>Connect one wire to "GND", and one to any of the numbers 1-13, <br>
                    for this tutorial we will be using '6'</p>

                        <h3>What does this mean?</h3>
                        <p>The holes in which you can insert your wires are called "pins" and those with numbers on them give power output, the ones with a '-' in front of them can give output from 0-255, whereas those without give either full power or nothing, depending on how you program them.<br>
                        The "GND" pin stands for "ground" and is the end of your circut.</p>

                    <p>Wire up the 220Ohm resistor and LED as shown in the diagram</p>

                            The breadboard connects all your components and wires without requiring soldering,<br>
                            The second diagram on the right shows which holes are conected to which others.<br>
                            The resistor reduces the amount of power going to the LED so it doesn't burn out <br>
                            The long leg of the LED is called the cathode and connects to the power source through the resistor.
                            <br>
                            The short leg is called the anode and connects to ground.

                        Well done! You have completed the circut, lets start coding!<br>
                        The code to make the LED flash is shown below, we will go through it line by line
