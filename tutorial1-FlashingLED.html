                <section>
                    <p>Connect one wire to "GND", and one to any of the numbers 1-13, <br>
                    for this tutorial we will be using '7'</p>

                        <h3>What does this mean?</h3>
                        <p>The holes in which you can insert your wires are called "pins" they can take input or give power output, depending on how you program them.<br>
                        The "GND" pin stands for "ground" and is the end of your circut.</p>

                <h2>Step 1</h2>
                <section>
                    <p>Wire up the 220Ohm resistor and LED as shown in the diagram</p>        
                    <aside class="extra">
                        <h3>What does this mean?</h3>
                        <p> 
                            The breadboard connects all your components and wires without requiring soldering,<br>
                            The second diagram on the right shows which holes are conected to which others.<br>
                            The resistor reduces the amount of power going to the LED so it doesn't burn out <br>
                            The long leg of the LED is called the cathode and connects to the power source through the resistor.
                            <br>
                            The short leg is called the anode and connects to ground.

                    <p>
                        Well done! You have completed the circut, lets start coding!<br>
                        The code to make the LED flash is shown below, we will go through it line by line
                    </p>
                    <img src="./images/ArduinoFlashCode.JPG" class="explainingImage">
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p class=code> void setup() {</p>                            
<!--                             <p class=code>int buttonPin = 2;<br>int LEDPin = 3;</p>
                            <p>
                                We are going to set buttonPin (orLEDPin) to something, <br>
                                every time you use buttonPin (orLEDPin) it will mean what you set it to. <br>
                                In this case we set buttonPin
                            </p> -->
                            <p>
                                "void" basically means "nothing", <br>
                                so in this case we can ignore it. <br>
                                "setup()" is the name of this block of code that runs when the program is started, to set everything up. <br>
                                The curly brackets go around the block of code.
                            </p>

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p class=code>    // put your setup code here, to run once:</p>                            
                            <p>
                                The "//" just means that everything after it on that line is a comment. <br>
                                It does nothing except tell the reader of the code something, <br>
                                This is very usefull, it can help you and others read and understand your code.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p class=code>   pinMode(7, OUTPUT);</p>                            
                            <p>
                                This sets pin 7's mode to OUTPUT, <br>
                                output means it will give the circut power <br>
                                Note how the last two lines are "indented", or moved forward 4 spaces, this shows that they are a part of "setup".<br>
                                You will also notice that the line ends with a semicolon, this shows that the line has ended.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p class=code>}</p>                            
                            <p>
                                Ends setup.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p class=code>void loop() {</p>                            
                            <p>
                                This contains the "loop" part of the code, it repeats till the Arduino is turned off or you tell it to.<br>
                                Note how this is very similar to "void setup() {}".
                            </p>
                            
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p class=code>  digitalWrite(7, HIGH);</p>                            
                            <p>
                                "digitalWrite" lets you change the power of a certain pin, in this case pin 7. <br>
                                You can use "HIGH" or "LOW" to turn the power on or off, which then switches the LED on and off. <br>
                                Note that this line is also indented because it belongs to the loop().
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p class=code>  delay(1000);</p>                            
                            <p>
                                "delay" pauses the program for the number of milliseconds specified in the brackets, In this case 1000<br>
                                One millisecond is 1/1000 of a second, so 1000 milliseconds is one second.
                                Note that this line is also indented because it belongs to the loop().
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p class=code>  digitalWrite(7, LOW);</p>                            
                            <p>
                                Turns off the LED, explained ubove.
                            </p>
                        </li> 
                        <li>
                            <p class=code>}</p>                            
                            <p>
                                End of the loop, when it reaches this is goes back to <p class=code>void loop() {</p>, then moves down, line by line till it reaches this statement again, and repeats.
                                The only way this cycle can be broken is through a return statement which we will cover later.
                            </p>
